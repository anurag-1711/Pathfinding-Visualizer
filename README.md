## Pathfinding and Maze Generating Visualizer

Graphical User Interface built using React to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. 

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Algorithm
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Bidirectional Greedy Search
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Random Walk

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
1. Random Maze
2. Recursive Division Maze
3. Vertical Division Maze
4. Horizontal Division Maze

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
